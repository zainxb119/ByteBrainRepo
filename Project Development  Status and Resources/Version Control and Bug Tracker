Version Control and Bug Tracker

We use Git/GitHub for version control. Clone the repo, create branches, commit, push, and make pull requests. 
GitHub Issues serves as our bug tracker; report issues, label them, assign to team members, and reference them in commits.
These tools streamline code management and issue tracking.
